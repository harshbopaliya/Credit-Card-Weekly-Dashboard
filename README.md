# Comprehensive Credit Card Weekly Dashboard

## Project Objective
To develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.

## Concept of the Project
Credit card operations are a crucial component of financial institutions, impacting customer satisfaction, profitability, and overall business performance. This project aims to create a real-time, interactive dashboard to monitor key metrics related to credit card usage, transactions, and customer behavior. By leveraging data analytics tools, the project seeks to provide actionable insights to stakeholders, facilitating informed decision-making and enhancing operational efficiency. This aligns with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, which aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation.

## Problem Statement
Credit card operations generate vast amounts of data daily, encompassing transactions, customer interactions, and financial performance metrics. However, this data often remains underutilized due to the lack of effective tools for real-time analysis and visualization. Without timely and accurate insights, stakeholders struggle to identify trends, address issues, and capitalize on opportunities. This project addresses this challenge by developing a comprehensive dashboard that consolidates and visualizes key credit card metrics, enabling stakeholders to monitor performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.

## Objective of the Project
The primary objective of this project is to develop a credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics. The specific objectives are:
- To consolidate and analyze credit card data from various sources.
- To visualize key performance metrics, including transaction volumes, customer behavior, and financial performance.
- To enable real-time monitoring of credit card operations through an interactive dashboard.
- To identify trends and patterns in credit card usage and performance.
- To facilitate data-driven decision-making by providing actionable insights to stakeholders.
- To enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction through timely and accurate information.

## Data Sources Used
The project will utilize data from the following sources:
- Internal Transaction Databases: Daily transaction data, including purchase amounts, merchant categories, and customer demographics.
- Financial Reporting Systems: Metrics related to revenue, expenses, and profitability.
- Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems: Data on customer interactions, feedback, and satisfaction levels.
- External Market Data: Industry benchmarks and market trends from financial analytics providers.

## Features
The key features of the dashboard will include:
- Transaction Metrics: Daily and weekly transaction volumes, average transaction value, and total spending by category.
- Customer Insights: Customer segmentation, spending patterns, and loyalty metrics.
- Financial Performance: Revenue, expenses, and profitability analysis.
- Trend Analysis: Temporal trends in key metrics, including seasonal patterns and anomalies.
- Alerts and Notifications: Real-time alerts for significant deviations from expected performance.
- Interactive Visualizations: Graphs, charts, and heatmaps for easy interpretation of data.

## Tools for Analysis
The following tools and technologies will be used for data analysis and dashboard development:
- Python: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- SQL: For querying and managing data from relational databases.
- Tableau: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- Power BI: For real-time data integration and advanced analytics.

## Hypothesis
The hypothesis of the project is that a real-time, interactive dashboard will significantly improve stakeholders' ability to monitor and analyze credit card operations, leading to better decision-making and enhanced operational efficiency. Additionally, by identifying trends and anomalies promptly, stakeholders can address issues proactively and capitalize on emerging opportunities.

## Methodology
The project will be conducted using the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method:
