project obejective : To develop a comprehensive credit 
card weekly dashboard that 
provides real-time insights into key 
performance metrics and trends, 
enabling stakeholders to monitor 
and analyze credit card operations 
effectively.

Credit card financial dashboard using Power BI:
• Developed an interactive dashboard using 
transaction and customer data from a SQL database, 
to provide real-time insights. 
• Streamlined data processing & analysis to monitor 
key performance metrics and trends.
• Shared actionable insights with stakeholders based 
on dashboard findings to support decision-making 
processes.



1) Import Data From SQL Database:
using pgadmin4 using PL/SQL:
create "ccdb" database that have two table : cc_detail , cust_detail



2)Data Processing And DAX Queries :

i)ADD new columns  AgeGroup,IncomeGroup in cust_detail table using this formula : 
AgeGroup = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 30, "20-30",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 30 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 40,"30-40",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 40 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 50,"40-50",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 50 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 60,"50-60",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 60 ,"60+",
    "unknown"
)

IncomeGroup = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
'public cust_detail'[income] <35000,"Low",
'public cust_detail'[income] >=35000 && 'public cust_detail'[income]<70000,"Med",
'public cust_detail'[income] >=70000,"High",
"unknown"
)

ii) Add new columns Revenue,week_num2 in cc_detail table using this formula : 

Revenue = 'public cc_detail'[annual_fees] + 'public cc_detail'[total_trans_amt] + 'public cc_detail'[interest_earned]

week_num2 = WEEKNUM('public cc_detail'[week_start_date])

iii) two measures current_week_revenue and previous_week_revenue :

Current_week_Reveneue = CALCULATE(
    SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]),
    FILTER(
        ALL('public cc_detail'),
        'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2] )))

Previous_week_Reveneue = CALCULATE(
    SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]),
    FILTER(
        ALL('public cc_detail'),
        'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2] ) - 1))


in business to find week on week percentage change : 
basic formula : (current value - previous value )/ previous value

that why we create third measure for week on week revenue  :

wow_Reveneue = DIVIDE(([Current_week_Reveneue] - [Previous_week_Reveneue]),[Previous_week_Reveneue])


3) Design Dashboard and get insights :

design two dashboard: Credit card Customer Report,Credit Card Transaction Report


4)add new data check project insights:
cc_add.csv and cust_add.csv means add new week data in sql and check dashboard 
week 53 data is added then:
WOW Change : 
	Revenue increased by 28.8%
	total_trans_amt - 35.03%
	total_trans_count - 3.39%
	customer_count  - 3.69%
